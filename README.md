In this task I had to follow the following points to create a simple analog of roulette.

## Step 1:

- Create a prompt window. Show the message inside the window â€˜Do you want to play a game?â€™.
- In case the user clicks the 'Cancel' button, the message 'You did not become a billionaire, but can.' should be shown.

## Step 2:

* If user clicked â€˜Okâ€™ â€“ start a game: randomly choose an integer number in range [0; 8] (including 0 and 8)and ask user to enter a number of pocket on which the ball could land.
* User has 3 attempts to guess a number.
* If user guessed the numberon which ball landed, on 1-st attempt prize is 100$ (maximum prize for current numbers range), 2-nd attempt â€“ 50$, 3-rd attempt â€“ 25$.
* If user did not guess a number show the message â€˜Thank you for your participation. Your prize is: â€¦ $â€™ (Use alert) and ask if he wants to play again.

## Step 3:

* If user did guess - Show the message â€˜Congratulation, you won! Your prize is: â€¦ $. Do you want to continue?â€™.
* If user does not want to continue â€“ show the message â€˜Thank you for your participation. Your prize is: â€¦ $â€™ (Use alert) and ask if he wants to play again.
* If user does want to continue, make number range bigger at 4 as the previous one (for example [0; 8] -> [0; 12]), and two times bigger maximum prize (for example on 1-st attempt prize will be 200$, 2-nd attempt â€“ 100$, 3-rd attempt â€“ 50$). Prize must be added to the previous one and number of attempts should be set to 3 (user should have 3 attempts to  guess a number for each numbers range)
* Each time you ask user to enter a number you should show him a range of cells, how much attempts he has left, his total prize and possible prize on current attempt.
